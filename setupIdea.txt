Step 1: Project Setup
Create a new project folder and set up your development environment, including installing Python, Flask, and Vue.js.
Initialize a Git repository for version control.

Step 2: Front End (Vue.js)
Design the user interface for both the Finance and Travel modes.
Create Vue components for various sections of your app, such as user authentication, expense tracking, income tracking, budgeting, destination research, itinerary building, etc.
Implement user authentication using a library like Vuex for state management.
Integrate Axios to make API requests to the back end.

Step 3: Back End (Flask API)
Set up a Flask project with a virtual environment.
Define the database models using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.
Implement user authentication and authorization using Flask-Login or a similar library.
Create API routes for managing expenses, incomes, budgets, trips, destinations, and other entities.
Implement the logic to link expenses, incomes, and budgets to specific trips.
Secure your API with appropriate validation and error handling.
Ensure CORS settings are correctly configured for the front-end application.

Step 4: Database (PostgreSQL)
Set up a PostgreSQL database, create tables for users, trips, expenses, incomes, budgets, destinations, and other relevant entities.
Define the relationships and constraints in the database schema.
You can use libraries like Flask-SQLAlchemy to facilitate the database interactions in your Flask app.

Step 5: Integration
Connect your Flask API to the PostgreSQL database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Ensure that expenses, incomes, and budgets can be associated with specific trips.

Step 6: Testing and Debugging
Thoroughly test the functionality of both the front-end and back-end components.
Debug and fix any issues that arise.

Step 7: Deployment
Deploy the front-end and back-end components to suitable hosting platforms (e.g., Netlify or Vercel for Vue.js, and Heroku for Flask).
Set up a PostgreSQL database for production.
Configure environment variables for sensitive data.

Step 8: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment processes.

Step 9: User Testing and Feedback
Invite users to test the application and provide feedback.

Step 10: Documentation and Presentation
Create documentation for your app, including setup instructions for other developers.
Prepare a presentation or demo for showcasing your project.
