# Capstone-Project--1
Integrated Finance and Travel Planning App

## User Authentication:

Users create accounts and log in.
They can switch between the "Finance" and "Travel" modes within the app.
Finance Mode:

## Expense Tracking: 
Users can track their everyday expenses as usual. Expenses can be categorized as usual, but they can also be associated with specific trips.
Income Tracking: Users can add income sources and link them to particular trips if applicable.
Budgeting: Users can set up budgets, and these budgets can be associated with specific trips. For example, they can create a "Paris Trip Budget" with specific budget categories like "Flights," "Accommodation," "Food," etc.
Financial Goals: Users can set financial goals for their trips. For instance, they might set a goal to save $1,000 for their "Europe Adventure." The app can track their progress towards this goal.
Reports: Users can generate financial reports that include both their regular financial activities and trip-specific finances.
Travel Mode:

## Destination Research: 
Users can browse and research potential travel destinations.
Itinerary Builder: They can create detailed trip itineraries, add activities and their associated costs, and link these activities to the budget categories set in the finance mode.
Accommodation and Flight Booking: Integrate features to search, book accommodations, and flights, and link these bookings to specific trips in the finance mode.
Budgeting: The app can show users how much they've spent and how much is remaining from their trip budgets.
Weather and Currency Conversion: Provide weather forecasts and currency conversion tools for the selected destination.
Sharing and Collaboration: Users can collaborate with others in planning their trips, and these collaboration notes can also be associated with trip budgets.
Integration:

## Expense and Income Linkage: 
Expenses and incomes can be linked to trips, and the app can automatically categorize expenses based on the trip they're associated with.
Budget Linkage: Budgets can be connected to specific trips and automatically adjust based on expenses and bookings.
Financial Reports: Reports can include both regular financial data and trip-specific financial data.
Data Synchronization: Changes made in one mode should sync with the other. For example, if a user books a flight in the "Travel" mode, it should affect the budget and expenses in the "Finance" mode.
